  ```

The project contains a `Dockerfile` at its root in order to create an image of the application.

A `docker-compose.yml` file also exists at the root in order to launch easily a container for the application.

- Build the image and launch the container.

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

⚠️ This command must be executed at the location of the `docker-compose.yml` file and have to be run as with the right privileges (administrator).
